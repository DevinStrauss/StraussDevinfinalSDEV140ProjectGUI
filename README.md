# StraussDevinfinalSDEV140ProjectGUI
This is my final project for SDEV 140. It is a GUI application created by using Tkinter in Python.
This GUI application is a log in screen. It allows a user to enter a username and password to login successfully. If the user does not have an account 
or exists then the user can create an account. The user can then use their username and password to login soon after creating the account.
